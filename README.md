# ComputerCraft Personal Library

This library is essentially just a collection of APIs and programs that I've written. Instead of having to write the same code over and over again, I decided to make an easily installable package.

## Installation Instructions

1. Download `get-ccpl.lua` by running `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BradyFromDiscord/CCPL/make-room-dev/programs/get-ccpl.lua`
2. Run `get-ccpl.lua`
And that's it! You can use the programs as if they were vanilla.

## Programs

The following are a list of programs included in this package:

#### farm
Usage: `farm <create/harvest> <x> <y>`
This program allows the user to either create or harvest a farm of "x" by "y" size.
When creating a farm, the farming API will ask for materials in specific slots. If the materials are not provided, the turtle will still create the farm, but you may have to manually place those materials.

#### gist
Usage: `gist <install/update> <file-name> <gist-url>`
This program is a quick way to download programs from Gist. It works similarly to the pastebin program, but allows you to overwrite the file at `<file-name>`. `update` just bypasses a warning that `install` displays when overwriting a file.

# Advanced Stuff

You only need this stuff if you're going to be programming with CCPL.

## Advanced Installation

There are custom flags that you may use with the `get-ccpl.lua` program:

| Flag             | Usage                                                         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-f`             | Force overwrites (does not stop custom path warning)          |
| `-i <path>`      | Install CCPL at `<path>`, may break badly written programs    |
| `-l [path/file]` | Dumps debug output to a log file. File defaults to `/log.txt` |
| `-s`             | Steps through debug output, in case you're into that          |

## Before using the APIs

Since there is no way to add custom paths to `require()`'s list of paths, and I have an option to install CCPL in a custom path, I needed a way to reference my APIs no matter where they are, even though `require()` would need an absolute path. 
This is the snippet to do that:
```lua
local _p = settings.get("ccpl.path")
local {api-name-here} = require(_p.."ccpl.apis.{api-name-here}")
```

Essentially, I have a custom setting that saves the location that CCPL is installed. As long as you append that path before `ccpl.apis`, your program will be able to use the API, even if CCPL is in a custom path.
